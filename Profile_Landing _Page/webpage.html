                    Hello, I am Ricardo Cardenas! I am a soon to graduate Senior,
                    I have some experience working with HTML and CSS but still have
                    much to learn for Web programming. I am super excited to learn new
                    techniques and tools that can better my webpage-making skills. Along
                    with my webpage-making skills I also know how to program in C++ and Python.
                    During my stay at the University of Houston - Downtown, I have taken
                    a large variety of classes, many of which are crucial for my carrer as a
                    programmer. Some of my favorite classes that I have taken so far are
                    Computer Organization, Internet of Things, Web Programming, and Intro to Python.
                    My goal is to enter the Entertainment industry and work as a Full Stack Web Developer.
                    In the past I have worked on many different projects, both individually and as 
                    part of a team. My project portfolio ranges from a Derby Simulator I programmed using
                    C++ in my intro to C++ class to a School Management database my team and I developed using
                    MySQL. I plan on graduating this upcoming semester, hopefully things go
                    back to normal and I can walk the stage along with my colleagues at Minute Maid Park.
